## Prerequisites

- MongoDB Atlas account

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-stack-authentication.git
   cd mern-stack-authentication
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Navigate to both the backend and frontend directories and install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   # For the backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # For the frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_PASSWORD= your_mongoose_password
   MONGO_USERNAME= your_mongoose_username
   MONGO_URL= your_mongoose_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET= your_jwt_secret_text
   ```

   Ensure you replace the values with your own if you are deploying this in a different environment.

4. **Database Setup**

   Ensure that your MongoDB Atlas cluster is correctly configured and accessible. You should replace the MongoDB credentials in the `.env` file with your own.

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Backend Server**

   Navigate to the `backend` directory and start the server:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the server on the port specified in your `.env` file (default is `3000`).

2. **Start the Frontend Application**

   Open a new terminal window, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and start the React development server:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

- **Sign Up**: Navigate to the sign-up page of the frontend application to create a new user account.
- **Sign In**: Use the sign-in page to log in with your credentials.
- **Logout**: Once logged in, you can log out using the logout button.
